Wind Waker rewrite
==================

Rewrite attempt with a top-down approach - code is rewritten in the order it's executed.


Notes
=====

This isn't a decompilation in that it's not trying to achieve binary equivalence. But one of the aim is to still preserve the same overall structure and naming conventions. So it's more of a rewrite, as was done with [A Link To The Past](https://github.com/snesrev/zelda3).
